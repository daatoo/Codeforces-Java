## About This Repository

Welcome to my personal Java repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my Java projects and code snippets. These projects range from basic exercises to more complex applications, showcasing my growth and learning journey in Java programming.

### Key Highlights

### Collaborative Work
While this repository hosts a selection of my individual work, the majority of my collaborative projects, especially those related to university coursework, are available in a shared repository. My friend and I have also started a YouTube channel for Java tutorials, primarily aimed at helping fellow students.
