## About This Repository

Welcome to my personal Java repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Java implementations showcasing various algorithms and data structures. These projects range from basic exercises to more complex applications, showcasing my growth and learning journey in Java programming.

## Repository Structure
This repository is neatly organized into four key directories, each containing Java code:

- **Artemis_Tasks**: Engaging Java exercises and challenges to test your programming mettle.
- **CodeForces**: Solutions for a variety of CodeForces problems, crafted in Java.
- **Data_structures**: Core Java implementations of essential data structures.
- **Simple_algorithms**: A range of basic algorithms that demonstrate fundamental coding techniques in Java.


### Key Highlights
